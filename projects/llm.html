				<h1>Abstract</h1>
				<p>
					Recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly impacted various robotic applications and task
					planning. However, a predominant focus on sequential processes has limited their potential for high-level, complex plans. This
					research delves into the systematic investigations of prompt engineering for LLM-generated behavior trees (BTs). In Experi-
					ment 1, we carefully designed BT-Prompt, which demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-generated BTs over other formats within
					few-shot scenarios. Experiment 2 underscores the significance of hierarchy, highlighting that mid-level subtrees play a pivotal
					role in successfully executing complex tasks across various LLM backbones and temperature settings. Notably, among
					the suboptimal BTs, it is noteworthy that LLMs attempted to autonomously generate mid-level subtrees without human
					guidance. These autonomously generated mid-level subtrees then become a central element in Experiment 3, where we confront
					the challenges presented by more complex tasks encountered in a robotics competition. In this context, it became evident that the
					pre-existing hand-coded mid-level subtrees were insufficient, whereas integrating the LLM-generated mid-level subtrees into existing
					functions resulting in enhanced task execution for these intricate challenges. Finally,this research collected illustrative examples
					of positive and negative prompting strategies of LLM-generated BTs, with demonstrations of successful executions in virtual and
					real environments

				<h1>Appendix A : Two main failure types</h1>

				<p> <b>Type 1 - The inclusion of unnecessary subtrees or a lack of
					necessary subtrees can result in task failure.</b><br>
					Adding unnecessary subtrees or lacking essential
					subtrees results in task failure. When LLM generates the
					”inspection” task, it incorporates the subtree related to the
					red-boxed area into the task plan. However, as this subtree is
					designed for ”tracking object,” it requires a target object to
					fulfill the task’s completion requirement. Since the ”inspection”
					task does not involve detecting objects, the behavior tree may
					halt at this stage due to the absence of a target object, causing
					it to be unable to progress further.</p>

					<img src="img/method_failure_1.png" alt="teaser" height="400"></div>

				<p><b>Type 2 - Misinterpretation of the logic expressed through
					example tasks can result in task failure.</b><br>
					Misinterpretation of the logic expressed through example
					tasks. When LLM generates the ”object navigation” task, it
					misinterprets the logic expression symbols within the red-
					boxed area (from fallback to sequence). Due to this incorrect
					interpretation of the logic expression symbols, the behavior
					tree is unable to transition to the tracking state even when it
					detects the target object.</p>

				<h1>Appendix B : New Tasks in Experiment 3 (RobotX Challenge 2022)</h1>
				<p><b>Detect and Dock (Dock.): </b> <br>
					In this task, there's a floating platform with three bays, each having a different color (red, green, or blue). 
					The AMS detects the color and docks in the bay with the matching color.
				<p><b>Scan the code (Scan.): </b> <br>	
					In this task, there's a three-sided light tower on a floating platform that displays a sequence of RGB lights. 
					The AMS observes the colors and their order and use this sequence for other tasks in later rounds.
				<p><b>Find and Fling(Shoot.): </b> <br>
					In this task, there's a floating platform with three panels, each having a colored square and two holes. 
					The AMS detects a designated color and shoots racquetballs through the panel's holes. 
					Each team gets four racquetballs for this.
				<p><b>Entrance and Exit Gates(Gate.): </b> <br>
					In this task, the AMS needs to go through gates marked by colored buoys and underwater beacons. 
					The AMS must detect the underwater beacon signals between these gates and enter through them before moving 
					on to other tasks. The task's complexity increases in each round and includes elements from other tasks.
					The beacons have different frequencies and activate one at a time during the task.There are three gates:
					<br>&nbsp &nbsp Gate 1 has a red and a white buoy.
					<br>&nbsp &nbsp Gate 2 has two white buoys.
					<br>&nbsp &nbsp Gate 3 has a white and a green buoy.

				<p><b>Wildlife Encounter (Wildlife.): </b> <br>
					Task involves three floating platforms that look like Australian marine animals: 
					a platypus, turtle, and crocodile. 
					The AMS detects and reacts to them using  Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) camera . 
					Teams can use a UAV for help. After detection, the AMS circles the platypus clockwise, 
					the turtle counterclockwise, and the crocodile twice in any direction.
				<p><b>UAV Search and Report (Search.): </b> <br>
					In this land-based UAV task mimicking a search and rescue operation, 
					the UAV starts from one point, searches a marked field with orange markers, finds two objects there, 
					and lands at another designated point. Teams can use any search pattern within the field boundaries. 
					They report the objects they locate and their exact positions.
				<p><b>Follow the Path (Follow.): </b> <br>
					This task requires the Autonomous Maritime System (AMS) to follow a designated path of white buoys, 
					pass through six pairs of red and green buoys, and exit through another set of white buoys. 
					The AMS must steer clear of randomly placed obstacles, symbolized by round black buoys. 
					Teams have the option to employ a UAV for assistance in completing this task.
				<p><b>UAV Replenishment (Deliver.): </b> <br>
					This task involves using a UAV. The UAV takes off from a USV, finds a floating helipad, picks up a small colored tin, 
					delivers the tin to a circular target area on another floating helipad, and then returns to the USV.
