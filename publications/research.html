				<h1>Spatially Prioritized and Persistent Text Detection and Decoding</h1>
				<p>
					Our method uses simultaneous
					localization and mapping (SLAM) to extract planar “tiles” repre-
					senting scene surfaces.
					This paper’s contributions include: 1) spatiotemporal fusion
					of tile observations via SLAM, prior to inspection, thereby
					improving the quality of the input data; and 2) combination of
					multiple noisy text observations into a single higher-confidence
					estimate of environmental text.

				<h1>Wearable Cyber-physical System for the Blind and Visually Impaired</h1>
				<p>
					We propose to develop a wearable platform to provide key vision functionalities for the blind and visually impaired, 
					For safe mobility, we develop methods for independent awareness of obstacles, drop-offs, ascents, descents etc. in the users
					path, even when the objects or hazards are small, complex or otherwise difficult to detect and characterize. To access to environmental text,
					We use pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) cameras to first localize text in wide field of view, and then zoom in to foveate suspected regions 
					due to the fact that the resolution requirement for text detection is different from decoding. Using rapidly refreshable tactile Braille device,
					we convey private, timely delivery of rich information, and also receive controls to and from a user in a feedback loop.

				<h1>The Attraction of Visual Attention to Texts in Real-World Scenes</h1>
				<h2><em>Where can you more likely find text?</em></h2>
				<p>
					The present study was aimed at investigating its underlying factors of human visual attention attracted by texts. 
					The following main results were obtained: (a) Greater fixation probability and
					shorter minimum fixation distance of texts confirmed the higher attractiveness of texts; (b) the locations where texts are
					typically placed contribute partially to this effect; (c) specific visual features of texts, rather than typically salient features
					(e.g., color, orientation, and contrast), are the main attractors of attention; (d) the meaningfulness of texts does not add to
					their attentional capture; and (e) the attraction of attention depends to some extent on the observer’s familiarity with the
					writing system and language of a given text.

				<h1>Degraded Character Recognition</h1>
				<h2><em>Can you read sentence (c)?</em></h2>
				<p>
					It is known that not all letters are of equal importance to the word recognition process, i.e., changing initial or exterior letters are more disruptchanging.
		 			Consistent results have been found for Chinese characters, and first-written strokes are more important for reading.
					This study compares the effects of high-level learnt stroke writting order and low-level features obtained via pixel-level singular value decompostion (SVD) 
					to readers' degraded character recognition. Our results suggest that the most important segments determined by SVD, which has no information about stroke writing order, 						can identify first-written strokes. Furthermore, our results suggest that contour may be correlated with stroke writing order.

				<h1>Predicting Semantic Transparency Judgments</h1>
				<h2><em>Do you read “butter” when you read “butterfly”? Or “馬” for “馬虎”?</em></h2>
					The morphological constituents of English compounds and two-character Chinese compounds may differ in meaning from the whole word.
					The proposed models successfully predicted participants’ transparency ratings, and the prediction is influenced by the differences in raters’ morphological processing 
					in the different writing systems. The dominance of lexical meaning, semantic transparency, and the average similarity between all pairs within a morphological family 
					are provided, and practical applications for future studies are discussed.
